                <p>
                    Riemann Sums can be used to describe multi-dimensional objects by breaking them down into cross sections.
                    Consider the follow equation that is graphed to the right. I we want to know the area under the curve, we
                    can simply take the integral from -4 to 4:

                <p>
                    This gives us an answer, but where did that answer come from? The fact that the integral yeilds the area is
                    proven by the Riemann Sum.

                    The region under a graph can be represented as a series of rectangles. Adding the area of all of these rectangles
                    is the Riemann Sum. This can be thought of as an approximation of the region under the curve. Use the slider below
                    to play with the number of rectangles. You can see the Riemann Sum calculated below.

            <h2>How is the Riemann Sum Calculated?</h2>
            <p>
                As the number of regions(partitions) increases, the approximation becomes closer and closer to the actual answer.
                No matter how many partitions we create, we will never reach the actual area. We will always be some tiny amount away.
                This addition of the regions produces a long summation:
            </p>

            <p>
                Since this notation can become very long and repetitive, a special symbol is used to describe the sum of these terms that
                follow a similar pattern:
            </p>
            <img src="images/equation3.jpg" alt="demonstration of sigma notation for the sequence of terms" class="equation">
            <p>
                The first thing we can do to simplify this equation is to remove the region width term. This is because the width of every
                region is the same by the definition of the Riemann Sum. The width term can be pulled off of each term, which allows it to
                come out of the summation procedure as a constant multiple:
            </p>
            <img src="images/equation4.jpg" alt="removing a constant term from sigma notation" class="equation">
            <p>
                Our next step is to solve for the w and h terms to make our equation generic to any function. Our region width is simply
                the length of the interval divided by the number of regions. The height of each region is the function value of the left side
                of the current region. This is simply the left bounds plus the ratio of current region over total regions times the total interval.
            </p>
            <img src="images/equation5.jpg" alt="solving for width and height based on any function f(x)" class="equation">
            <p>
                Plugging all of this in yields this duanting equation:
            </p>

            <p>
                This can be used to calculate Riemann Sums for normal intervals of a function. The higher the value used for r, the more accurate your
                answer becomes but at the tradeoff of taking longer to compute. For those familiar with programming, the summation can be thought of
                as a for loop that loops r times.
