                <p>
                    Riemann Sums can be used to describe multi-dimensional objects by breaking them down into cross sections.
                    Consider the follow equation that is graphed to the right. I we want to know the area under the curve, we
                    can simply take the integral from -4 to 4:

                <p>
                    This gives us an answer, but where did that answer come from? The fact that the integral yeilds the area is
                    proven by the Riemann Sum.

                    The region under a graph can be represented as a series of rectangles. Adding the area of all of these rectangles
                    is the Riemann Sum. This can be thought of as an approximation of the region under the curve. Use the slider below
                    to play with the number of rectangles. You can see the Riemann Sum calculated below.

            <h2>How Does the Riemann Sum Relate to the Integral?</h2>
            <p>
                As the number of regions(partitions) increases, the approximation becomes closer and closer to the actual answer.
                No matter how many partitions we create, we will never reach the actual area. We will always be some tiny amount away.
